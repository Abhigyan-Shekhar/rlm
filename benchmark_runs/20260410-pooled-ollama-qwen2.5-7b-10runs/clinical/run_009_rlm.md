│   Step 1: PT-2247 is receiving Compound VX-7 (high dose, 80mg).              │

│   Step 3: Therefore, PT-2247 should be on continued renal monitoring.        │

 The context appears to be a clinical trial record document with a lot of noise (filler text) at the beginning. However, since we have the entire document, we can use the `rlm_query` function to analyze its contents and extract relevant information.

Let's begin by using `rlm_query` to identify sections related to the success or outcome of the clinical trial.
```repl
trial_sections = rlm_query(f"In this long clinical trial record document, please identify key sections related to the success or failure of the trial, and briefly summarize them. Here is a chunk: {context}")
print(trial_sections)
```
